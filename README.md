# Hello, I'm Tanaka Gabriel Gozo! 👋

I'm a Computer Science & Physics student at Gettysburg College (Class of 2026) with a passion for building scalable software systems, working on innovative IoT solutions, and exploring scientific computing. My experiences range from building cloud-native infrastructure at Splunk/Cisco to developing IoT backend systems at Amazon and running high-performance simulations in research labs.

## 💼 Experience
- **Software Engineer Intern @ Splunk (Cisco), Boulder (May 2025–Aug 2025)**  
  - Deployed and managed Kubernetes-based services with containerized applications.  
  - Streamlined development workflows via CI/CD integration and optimized PostgreSQL, reducing delivery time by 30%.  
  - Implemented observability solutions with Prometheus telemetry, Grafana dashboards and alerting systems.  

- **IoT Engineering Intern @ Amazon, Boston (May 2024–Aug 2024)**  
  - Designed a C++ backend system to control networked sensors and real-time alerting via Arduino.  
  - Developed a mobile companion app and Node.js REST API to control IoT devices through Wi‑Fi.  
  - Implemented unit and integration tests and optimized performance, cutting system false positives by 20%.  

- **Student Research Intern, Cross‑Disciplinary Science Institute (May 2023–Aug 2023)**  
  - Built high-performance Monte Carlo simulation pipelines in Python and Fortran on Linux clusters to study neutron spin dynamics.  
  - Applied parallel processing and data structures to handle large-scale data with 50+ simulation batches weekly.  

- **Teaching Assistant, Gettysburg College (Aug 2023–Present)**  
  - Contributed as a Teaching Assistant for an introductory physics class, providing comprehensive support in homework, conceptual understanding, readings, and laboratory techniques.  
  - Actively assisted over 40 students weekly, dedicating 8 hours to ensuring their academic success.
